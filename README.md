# 🏥 Hospital Management System (Advanced CLI)

A **Command-Line Hospital Management System** built with **Python**.  
This project is designed for managing patient records efficiently, using only core Python concepts like **lists, dictionaries, loops, conditions, and functions**.  

It is a perfect beginner-friendly project to demonstrate **real-world programming logic** with Python.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ **Admit Patient** – Store patient details including ID, Name, Age, Disease, Assigned Doctor, Room, and Bill.  
✅ **View Patients** – Display all admitted patients in a neatly formatted table.  
✅ **Search Patient** – Search patients by **ID** or **Name**.  
✅ **Discharge Patient** – Discharge a patient and **auto-generate a receipt**.  
✅ **Manual Receipt Generation** – Generate receipts on demand.  
✅ **User-Friendly CLI Menu** – Simple and clear navigation.  

---

## 🗄️ Data Storage
- Patient records are stored in a **list of dictionaries**.  
- Each patient gets a **unique auto-generated ID** (e.g., `HSP-001`, `HSP-002`).  
- No external database required – everything runs in Python memory.  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**  
- Core concepts:
  - Variables
  - Lists & Dictionaries
  - Functions
  - Loops & Conditions
  - Input/Output
  - Date & Time (`datetime` module)
